# Submitting Changes

##### Prerequisite Tutorials: [Getting Started](Getting_Started.md)

After you have modified your local git repository, whether with updates to textures, models, source, documentation, or anything else, the steps to submit your changes are the same. You must stage, commit, push and push your changes, then submit a pull request which details all of the changes you have made. If you do not know how to do this, simply follow the steps of [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) by Lisa Tagliaferri that you may recognize from the Getting Started tutorial. In particular, you need to follow the "Making Changes Locally" section and all following sections. Here are a couple of guidelines we have in place for submitting contributions which you should keep in mind when following the previous instructions:
- Commit messages should follow the [7 rules laid out by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules). We are flexible on the subject line size, but it should virtually always be less than 70 characters.
- Pull requests should similarly have a brief, descriptive title. The pull request body should contain a full explanation of what changes were made and why where necessary. If it relates to another pull reqest or issue, that should be referenced with #<number>, and if it closes that particular issue, the [close syntax](https://github.com/blog/1386-closing-issues-via-commit-messages) should either be in the pull request or one of the commit message bodies.

Thank you very much for contributing to our project! None of this would have been possible without the help of people like you :grin:
